Brief description of each program

Program 01
🌱 Soil Moisture Monitoring System
A lightweight, object-oriented C++ program designed to simulate and manage real-time data collection from multiple soil sensors in an agricultural environment.

🚀 Key Features
Encapsulation: Secures sensor properties (sensorId, moistureLevel, timestamp) using private access specifiers, exposing them safely through controlled methods.
Dynamic Management: Leverages std::vector and emplace_back to efficiently store and scale multiple sensor instances.
Real-Time Updates: Includes methods to update and track changing moisture levels and timestamps dynamically.
Const Correctness: Implements const member functions (displayData()) to guarantee data integrity during read operations.
📊 Sample Output
=== Morning Sensor Readings ===
Sensor: S001 | Moisture: 45.2% | Time: 08:00
Sensor: S002 | Moisture: 52.8% | Time: 08:00
Sensor: S003 | Moisture: 38.5% | Time: 08:00

=== Updated Reading ===
Sensor: S001 | Moisture: 47.5% | Time: 09:00
program 02
📚 Student Attendance Management System
A simple, object-oriented C++ program designed to track, manage, and calculate student attendance percentages dynamically.

🚀 Key Features
Encapsulation: Secures student details and attendance metrics (rollNo, name, totalDays, presentDays) using private access specifiers.
Dynamic Tracking: Easily records daily attendance status (present/absent) and incrementally updates statistics using member functions.
Safe Computations: Automatically calculates attendance percentages while safely handling division-by-zero edge cases.
Const Correctness: Implements const member functions (getAttendancePercentage(), display()) to ensure internal data remains protected during read operations.
📊 Sample Output
=== Attendance Report ===
Roll: 101 | Name: Atharv | Attendance: 66.6667%
Roll: 102 | Name: mina | Attendance: 100%
program 03
🛒 Product Inventory & Catalog System
A robust, object-oriented C++ program designed to manage product details, monitor inventory stock, and track active catalog instances globally using static class members.

🚀 Key Features
Encapsulation: Protects sensitive product information (productId, productName, price, stockQuantity) using private access modifiers.
Static Member Tracking: Uses a static variable (totalProducts) and a static member function (getTotalProducts()) to maintain a real-time count of active product instances.
Inline Optimization: Employs the inline keyword for high-frequency getter methods to improve execution efficiency.
Automatic Resource Management: Implements a destructor that automatically decrements the product count when objects are destroyed.
Const Correctness: Utilizes const member functions to guarantee data safety during read and display operations.
